# to-do
After learning the fundamentals of JS. I decided to do a small project of creating a to do list.

During the planning phase, I was like this shouldn't be too hard. But when I started coding, I had to change my approach several times, do a bunch of googling, but eventually I did figure out the mistakes that I was making.
It took me a while to understand why I should use a list to showcase all the tasks instead of a flexbox. And as soon as I changed my approach most of the problems that I was facing were gone.
Furthermore, I tried doing with jQuery, but then settled with vanilla JS for ease of use and understanding.
